## Overview

**MFERL** (Multi-Feature Enhanced Representation Learning) integrates various biological features and similarity networks to effectively learn embeddings for predicting potential circRNAâ€“disease associations.

---

## Environment Requirement

To run this project, make sure you have the following Python environment:

```bash
torch == 1.7.1+cu110
numpy == 1.19.5
matplotlib == 3.5.1
dgl-cu110 == 0.5.3
scikit-learn == 0.24.2
```

---

## Model Structure

- **`MFERL_model.py`**: The core model implementing multi-feature enhanced representation learning.
- **`attention_layer.py`**: Feature-level attention module.
- **`fivefold_CV.py`**: Implements 5-fold cross-validation for performance evaluation.
- **`case_study.py`**: Predicts candidate circRNAs for given diseases.

---

## Datasets

The `datasets/` folder contains the benchmark datasets used in the experiments. These include:
- circRNA and miRNA features
- Similarity matrices
- Interaction matrices

Note: Some large dataset files are managed with Git LFS.
